        <h1>The Housing Headaches   </h1>
        <p>The Housing Headaches: Why Homes Are Harder to Find and Afford </p>
        <img src="./header images/Kenyan Govt Signs Affordable Housing Deals With 26 Counties.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="contentholder">
            <div class="holder2">
                <h1>Sky-High Prices & Affordability Gap </h1>
                <p>While home price growth has slowed in some markets, values remain near historic peaks, 
significantly outpacing income growth for decades. In the US, for instance, the median house 
price has risen to over five times the median household's annual income, compared to about 
3.5 times in the 1980s. 
• Financialization of Housing: Housing has increasingly been treated as an investment 
tool rather than a social necessity. This attracts large institutional investors who buy up 
available properties, limiting supply and driving up prices for typical families. 
• Rising Hidden Costs: Beyond the mortgage, annual "hidden" costs like insurance, 
property taxes, and maintenance are surging, hitting first-time buyers and those in high
cost metro areas the hardest. </p>
                <h2>The Interest Rate "Lock-In" Effect</h2>
                <p>In an effort to combat inflation, central banks worldwide raised interest rates. While this was 
intended to cool demand, it has had an unusual effect on the housing supply: 
• Sidelined Buyers: Higher rates mean monthly mortgage payments are drastically more 
expensive, significantly reducing the purchasing power and ability of potential buyers to 
qualify for a loan. 
• Stuck Sellers (Low Inventory): Many existing homeowners refinanced during the period 
of historically low rates (2020-2022). They are now reluctant to sell their homes, as 
doing so would mean trading their existing low-rate mortgage for a much higher one on 
a new property. This 'lock-in' effect keeps a large number of potential homes off the 
market, exacerbating the supply shortage. </p>
              <h2> The Decades-Long Supply Shortage </h2>
              <p>The lack of available homes (low inventory) is not a new issue; it's a structural problem 
compounded by recent events: 
• Underbuilding since 2008: Following the Great Recession, new home construction 
dropped precipitously and has largely failed to keep pace with population growth and 
demand. 
• High Construction Costs: Builders face high costs for land, materials, and a persistent 
shortage of skilled labor, which makes it less profitable to build, particularly for lower
priced, affordable housing. 
• Restrictive Zoning and Regulation: Local regulations and zoning laws (often driven by 
NIMBY—Not In My Backyard—opposition) restrict housing density and slow down the 
approval process, preventing new supply from meeting demand. </p>
              <h2>Impact on the Housing Market </h2>
              <p>This collision of high prices, high rates, and low inventory creates a stagnant, yet fiercely 
competitive, market: 
Affected Group Impact 
First-Time 
Buyers 
Completely priced out. They face a highly competitive market where high 
prices and high monthly payments create an insurmountable barrier. 
Current 
Homeowners 
Those with low-rate mortgages are "locked in," delaying moves for work or 
family changes, which decreases overall mobility. 
The Economy 
Housing transactions have slowed significantly, dragging down economic 
activity and creating risks of economic instability if prices become completely 
detached from fundamental values (income/rents). 
The challenge for policymakers is balancing the need to build more affordable housing (supply
side fix) with managing the high costs and elevated interest rates (demand-side pressures).
